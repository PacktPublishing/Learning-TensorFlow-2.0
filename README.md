# Learning-TensorFlow-2.0
A guide to building deep learning systems	<br/>

This is the code repository for [Learning TensorFlow 2.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/learning-tensorflow-20-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
TensorFlow is one of the most popular Google Deep Learning libraries and has become the industry standard for building AI applications. With the new release of TensorFlow 2.0, its many powerful new features speed up the development process.
In this course, we talk about all these new features and paradigms. With our TensorFlow course, you'll master TensorFlow concepts, learn to apply algorithms, and build artificial neural networks—all of these are crucial to Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence. After you've mastered the new features in TensorFlow 2.0, you'll be able to rapidly build prototypes and move them to production.
By the end of this course, you will be able to implement models effectively, easily, and confidently with TensorFlow 2.0.
